// ⚠ SONNET-PINNED COPY of the built-in code-review workflow (pinned 2026-06-25).
// The only change from the built-in: the finder, verifier, and sweep agent() calls
// pass `model: "sonnet"` so the bulk fan-out runs cheap instead of inheriting the
// (expensive) session model; scope + synthesize stay on the session model. Invoke
// this by scriptPath (or by name if the registry lets a user workflow shadow the
// built-in). RE-SYNC if the built-in gains finder angles / logic — diff against a
// freshly generated built-in script and re-apply the three `model: "sonnet"` lines.
//
// code-review: Scope → pipeline(per-angle Find → Verify) → Sweep (xhigh/max) → Synthesize
// Effort parameterization mirrors the inline /code-review cells:
//   high  → 3 correctness + 5 cleanup angles × 6 → ≤10 findings
//   xhigh → 5 correctness + 5 cleanup angles × 8 → sweep → ≤15 findings
//   max   → same structure as xhigh (the API reasoning effort differs, not the fan-out)
